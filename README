QtEmu
=====

QtEmu is a graphical user interface for QEMU written in Qt4.
It has the ability to run virtual operating systems on native
systems. This way you can easily test a new operating system
or try a Live CD on your system without any troubles and dangers.

Installation
------------
Download a source archive from the QtEmu project website
(http://qtemu.org/). Most probably you have already
done so ;).

Qt 4.2 is at least required.

Compilation with qmake from Qt4 (recommended):
* unpack the source tarball
* run 'qmake' in the qtemu folder
* type 'make'
* start ./qtemu and have fun!

Compilation with cmake:
(Use this methode on Linux to install the project systemwide.)
* run 'make -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/qtemu .' in order to
  install all files into /opt/qtemu.
* type 'make install' as root
* start it now with qtemu
